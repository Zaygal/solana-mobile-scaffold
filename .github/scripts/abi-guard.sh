#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Native ABI guard: prove every packaged native library can actually be loaded.
#
# Why this exists: Zaycomm shipped an APK that crashed on first launch with
#
#   UnsatisfiedLinkError: dlopen failed: cannot locate symbol
#   "__cxa_init_primary_exception" referenced by .../libNitroModules.so
#
# Nothing in the build caught it. The APK built, the bundle packed, the tests
# passed. The failure only appeared when Android tried to resolve the library's
# symbols at runtime. The cause was two toolchains in one APK: libNitroModules.so
# was compiled with clang 21 (whose libc++ exports __cxa_init_primary_exception)
# while the libc++_shared.so packaged alongside it came from clang 18 (which does
# not). This script checks that relationship directly.
#
# Method: for each packaged .so, collect its UNDEFINED C++ runtime symbols
# (__cxa_* / __gxx_*) and confirm each is DEFINED by the libc++_shared.so in the
# same ABI directory, or exported by the system loader (libc/libdl/libm/liblog,
# which Android always provides). Anything unresolved would fail dlopen on a
# device exactly as reported.
#
# Usage: sh abi-guard.sh <path-to.apk> [abi ...]
